The aim of this paper is to further the understanding of embodiment by 1) analytically
determining the components deﬁning embodiment, 2) increasing comparability and
standardization of the measurement of embodiment across experiments by providing a
universal embodiment questionnaire that is validated and reliable, and 3) motivating
researchers to use a standardized questionnaire. In this paper we validate numerically
and reﬁne our previously proposed Embodiment Questionnaire. We collected data from
nine experiments, with over 400 questionnaires, that used all or part of the original
embodiment 25-item questionnaire. Analysis was performed to eliminate non-universal
questions, redundant questions, and questions that were not strongly correlated with
other questions. We further numerically categorized and weighted sub-scales and
determined that embodiment is comprised of interrelated categories of Appearance,
Response, Ownership, and Multi-Sensory. The ﬁnal questionnaire consists of 16
questions and four interrelated sub-scales with high reliability within each sub-scale,
Chronbach’s α ranged from 0.72 to 0.82. Results of the original and reﬁned questionnaire
are compared over all nine experiments and in detail for three of the experiments. The
updated questionnaire produced a wider range of embodiment scores compared to the
original questionnaire, was able to detect the presence of a self-avatar, and was able to
discern that participants over 30 years of age have signiﬁcantly lower embodiment scores
compared to participants under 30 years of age. Removed questions and further research
of interest to the community are discussed.

Embodiment science is the ﬁeld inside virtual reality (VR) research that studies and attempts to
understand the effects of self-avatars on its users (Spanlang et al., 2014). Embodied avatars are
deﬁned to be avatars that are co-located with the user’s body and seen from a ﬁrst person perspective
within an immersive virtual environment (VE) (Kilteni et al., 2012).
Research in this ﬁeld has shown evidence of the importance of being embodied in the self-avatar.
Beyond the obvious needs of being virtually represented to interact with others in social VR setups,
being embodied has been shown to increase users cognitive abilities (Steed et al., 2016), improve
haptic performance (Maselli et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Franco and Berger, 2019) or increase self
recognition and identiﬁcation through enfacement (Gonzalez-Franco et al., 2020b). However, the
cognitive load impacts of self-avatars are not well understood and may affect results (Peck et al., 2018;
Peck and Tutar, 2020). Lush et al. Lush et al. (2020) has raised concerns that the illusion may be a
response to imaginative suggestion and is caused by suggestion. Regardless, being embodied in an

Embodiment Questionnaire

avatar can dramatically change a user’s experience in VR,
including reducing biases, such as racial bias (Peck et al.,
2013), mitigating stereotype threat (Peck et al., 2018; Peck
et al., 2020a), responding to a domestic violence scenario
(Gonzalez-Liencres et al., 2020), or affecting how users move
and act inside VR (Kilteni et al., 2013; Gonzalez-Franco et al.,
2020a).
A standardized measurement of embodiment is needed to be
able to compare and replicate experiments across embodiment
science. Further, participants are unique and can have
signiﬁcantly different experiences and responses in the same
VR setup. For example, avatars have been shown to enhance
distance estimation (Ries et al., 2008; Ebrahimi et al., 2018),
object size estimation (Jung et al., 2018; Ogawa et al., 2019),
and the level of embodiment in an avatar may further affect
distance perception (Gonzalez-Franco et al., 2019). A
standardized embodiment questionnaire that is sensitive
enough to detect individual embodiment differences could
aid researchers in better understanding and interpreting the
effects of virtual embodiment. Research using self-avatars
should measure embodiment on every experiment to rule
out and understand intrinsic variables that might be
affecting results.
There are challenges to measuring embodiment due to the
relation with our own bodies not being something we normally
think about. Questions such as “I felt out of my body”, can be
unrelatable to the many people who have neither experienced nor
heard about an autoscopic phenomena (Blanke and Mohr, 2005).
There have been attempts to measure embodiment to bridge the
gap between the user’s physiological experience and reporting of
the experience. The most advanced measures include
electrophysiological recordings to ﬁnd quantitative methods
(González Franco, 2014; Alchalabi et al., 2019). Previous
research has shown that highly embodied participants
responded with stronger 400N amplitudes in the parietal
cortex when they lost agency over their bodies (Padrao et al.,
2016; Pavone et al., 2016), or had stronger P300 responses when
their virtual avatar was threatened (González-Franco et al., 2014).
In both experiments researchers found correlations between these
numerical and physiological responses and a series of
embodiment questions. This supports that subjective
questionnaires are less cumbersome and yet still a valid form
of embodiment evaluation. However, questions need to account
for the challenge of asking someone about something they are not
able to quantify. A similar challenge was introduced by Slater
when addressing why questionnaires cannot fully assess presence
in VEs, (Slater, 2004).
With that aim in mind a new questionnaire was introduced by
(Gonzalez-Franco and Peck, 2018) “Avatar Embodiment.
Toward a Standardized Questionnaire.” In this questionnaire
the authors proposed 25 questions for an embodiment
questionnaire, as collected from the most used embodiment
questions in the literature. Starting with the original rubber
hand illusion introduced by Botvinick and Cohen (Botvinick
and Cohen, 1998) the authors analyzed up to 30 other
experiments. The new questionnaire not only included
sufﬁcient control questions but also categorized the main

Frontiers in Virtual Reality | www.frontiersin.org

questions into six different recurrent themes in embodiment
science (Kilteni et al., 2012, 2015; Maselli and Slater, 2013,
Maselli and Slater, 2014) such as: 1) body ownership, 2)
agency and motor control, 3) tactile sensations, 4) location of
the body, 5) external appearance and 6) response to external
stimuli. The paper proposed a calculation for a ﬁnal embodiment
score that could be achieved arithmetically or through an open
sourced Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
However, given the nature of the questionnaire based only on
a review of previously used questions, the authors carefully titled
the paper as an ongoing effort Toward a standardized
questionnaire, and highlighted that there would be a need to
further validate the questions by the community.
In this paper we validate the original questions, improve upon
the proposed questionnaire using exploratory factor analysis, and
demonstrate the usefulness of the new questionnaire with
additional analysis for three studies. Over the course of the
last 3 years we collected data from nine experiments that used
all or part of the original questionnaire. This accumulated a total
of 443 completed questionnaires. We then completed exploratory
factor analysis with three main goals:
1. Determine a relevant subset of questions by removing
redundant and unrelated questions to create a universally
usable queationnaire.
2. Group related questions into sub-scales and provide an
accurate and usable embodiment calculation.
3. Validate that the revised questionnaire is reliable and able
to better discriminate between individual participant
embodiment scores.
Our analysis converged into a reduced questionnaire that
proposes 16 questions of the original 25, and four sub-scales
instead of the original six. The revised questionnaire is compared
to the original on n  101 participants, the results of which are
used in the discussion of this paper to further understand the
revised embodiment questionnaire. We also discuss potential
reasons why some commonly used questions rendered
irrelevant, as well as highlight the importance of using a
common questionnaire across the ﬁeld.

2 MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
All studies run by either author since the original embodiment
questionnaire was proposed that collected data from all or part
of the original embodiment questionnaire (Gonzalez-Franco
and Peck, 2018) were included in the data analysis. This
included nine user studies. There were a total of 443
questionnaires (Table 1) completed by 124 women, 199 men,
two non-binary participants, and 118 non-reported. The
participant ages ranged from 18 to 76 with an average age of
31.65 ± 11.22. The diversity of the studies is also of interest to
our validation, hence we strived to collect data from experiments
in motor control, haptics and perception (Berger and GonzalezFranco, 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Peck and Tutar, 2020), distance
estimation and locomotion (Abtahi et al., 2019; Gonzalez-

included experiments that were within and between participants
as well as single condition experiments in which embodiment
was measured to ﬁnd the effects of high and low embodiment on
a secondary measure (Gonzalez-Franco et al., 2019; Seitz et al.,
2020). Embodiment further varied by including full body-swap
illusions, partial body-swap illusions, hand representation
illusions and avatar body modiﬁcations.

Additionally some form of passive haptics such as feet touching
the ﬂoor should exist (tactile). Recommendations about adapting
questions to studies can be found in Section 5.
After removing these three non-universal questions (Q4, Q5,
and Q25) we explored the correlation matrix to determine if
questions were correlated with each other and to make sure that
no questions had values above 0.9. Three questions were
identiﬁed that had correlation values above 0.3 with only two
other questions, namely Q2, Q7, and Q23. Additionally, Q9 and
Q19 had correlation values above 0.3 with only three other
questions.
We further removed the three questions that were only
correlated with two other questions (Q2, Q7, and Q23). Using
the correlation matrix of the remaining 19 questions we veriﬁed
sampling adequacy for analysis using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) measure, KMO  0.78 which is considered “good”
(Hutcheson and Sofroniou, 1999). However, Q9 had the
lowest individual KMO value of 0.56 which is close to the
minimal 0.5 cut-off. We additionally remove Q9 due to it
having the lowest individual KMO value and not being
correlated with many other questions.
Principle component analysis was run on the remaining 18
questions. The KMO measure was 0.79 and all individual item
KMO values were above 0.68. Bartlet’s test of sphericity indicated
that between item correlations were sufﬁciently large for PCA,
χ 2 (153)  3159.33, p < 0.0001.
Eigenvalues were computed for each component of the data.
The ﬁrst ﬁve principle components sum-of-squared loadings
were greater than one and could be extracted based on Kaiser’s
criterion of one and this was further supported by a visual
examination of the scree plot. These ﬁve components explained
64% of the variance in the data. The average communalities was
0.64 which is higher than the necessary 0.6 further supporting
the extraction of ﬁve factors. Finally, the ﬁt of the PCA model
was 0.95 suggesting that the model is a good ﬁt. Fewer than 50%
of the model’s residuals were greater than 0.05 with a rootmean square of 0.07. The structure matrix was created by
rotating using oblique rotation due to the likelihood of subscales correlating with each other. Questions were grouped
according the factor loadings of the structure matrix that
were greater than |0.4|. The ﬁve clusterings of questions
were categorized as Appearance, Response, Multi-Sensory,

3 METHODS
Exploratory factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) was performed following the recommended procedure
proposed by Field et al. (Field et al., 2012). A correlation matrix
between participant responses of each question was calculated
and Bartlett’s test of sphericity, χ 2 , was calculated to verify
signiﬁcantly large correlations between items to perform PCA
analysis. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measures were used to
verify sampling adequacy and question removal following the
recommendation that individual items have to be above the
acceptable limit of 0.5. PCA was used to detect the main
factors explored by the questionnaire. PCA analysis calculates
loadings for more relevant questions that have greater variability
among participants, and clusters them based on their algebraic
alignment. The factors that emerge from PCA on the
questionnaire responses are selected using Kaiser’s criterion
of one.

4 RESULTS
For the remainder of the paper we will refer to questions from
(Gonzalez-Franco and Peck, 2018) as Q# and the revised
questions as R#. We ﬁrst identiﬁed questions that could not
be universally adapted to embodiment experiments. This
included Q4 and Q5 that reference a mirror and Q25 which
speciﬁcally references harm to the avatar. Other questions should
be adaptable to any experiment. For example, VR experiments
should at least provide a ﬁrst-person perspective that controls the
view of the scene (agency) even if the avatar does not move.

computed for each component of the data. The ﬁrst four
principle components sum-of-squared loadings were greater
than one and extracted based on Kaiser’s criterion of one
which was further supported by a visual examination of the
scree plot. These four components explained 61% of the variance
in the data. The average communalities was 0.61 and the ﬁt of
the PCA model was 0.94. 50% of the model’s residuals were
greater than 0.05 with a root-mean square of 0.07. The residuals
were normally distributed with no outliers. The factor loadings
after oblique rotation are shown in Table 2 with the
corresponding structure matrix in Table 3 and pattern
matrix of factor correlations in Table 4 indicating that the
four sub-scales are interrelated.
Each of these four factors was inspected and no individual
question had an item-rest correlation below 0.30. All questions
with factor loadings above |0.40| were included in each sub-scale.
Note that numerous questions contributed to two sub-scales
further supporting the interrelation of the sub-scales.
Question groups included all questions with a weight above
0.4 as determined from the PCA structure matrix, (see
Table 3). The score for each sub-group was calculated with
equal weight given to each question. These four interrelated
question groups each had high reliability, Chronbach’s α of
0.79, 0.82, 0.76, and 0.72 respectively. (Gonzalez-Franco and
Peck, 2018).

Ownership, and Location. However, the Location factor had
low reliability, Chronbach’s α  0.52, indicating that the factor
and related questions (Q3 and Q11) should be removed from
the ﬁnal questionnaire. Further, it appears that Location is least
correlated with the other factors with correlation factors
ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 (see Supplementary Tables S1–S3
of the supplementary material).

Embodiment Questionnaire

In total 16 of the original 25 questions remained. Nine
questions were removed due to low relevance as indicated by
the above analysis or not being able to be generally applied to
embodiment experiments. All in all, after this thorough analysis
and validation the questions removed from original questionnaire
were:

inﬂuencing my own movements”
• R4 “It felt as if my (real) body were turning into an “avatar”
body”

• Q25. “I had the feeling that I might be harmed by the ____”

5 EMBODIMENT QUESTIONNAIRE
The ﬁnal questionnaire consists of 16 questions that can
be adapted for all embodiment experiments that enable
some amount of agency, for example movement of the
head or a hand. R7 allows for experiment speciﬁcs to
customize the question based on the independent variable
of the study. i.e. if a speciﬁc body swap or if a threat is involved,
such as, “I felt as if my body was older” or “I felt as if my hand
was attacked.” R8 and R9 can be adapted to non-threat
situations such as “I felt a realistic sensation in my body
when I saw my hand” or “I felt that my own body could
have been affected by the virtual world.” Although we cannot
guarantee that these questions are identical, they give freedom
to the experimenter to customize the questionnaire for the
many varying embodiment studies. The customization
supports wider use of a standardized questionnaire and
better comparability between experiments. In situations
where there are no active touching situations the
participant will likely still experience some form of passive
haptics such as their feet touching the ground or their hand
resting on a table.

References in the questionnaire to body would need to be
updated only if a body part is being explored. Blank spaces ____
depend on the experiment. The ____ marked with * can refer to
the touch of the ground and the feet in touch with the virtual ﬂoor,
this interpretation is preferable to removing the questions if there
are no further tactile stimuli.
Ideally the experimental design will include these questions in a
randomized order to limit context effects, and using a 7-point Likertscale directly at the end of the experiment or of each condition if the
study is within participants. The Likert-scale should range from:

Strongly disagree

Disagree

Somewhat disagree

Neither agree nor disagree

original questionnaire (M  .76, SD  0.22), t(8)  2.78,
p  0.02, r  0.47. The main aspect to note is that there are no
major changes beyond the ampliﬁcation of the dynamic range of
the reﬁned scale. The scores are more spread which indicates
more sensitivity of the reﬁned questionnaire providing more
granularity to identifying embodiment.

5.1 Computing the Score

The ﬁnal embodiment score will be in a range from 1–7 indicating
low to high embodiment. To compute a ﬁnal embodiment score,
calculate each sub-scale by averaging questions within each subcategory. Note that many questions are used in two sub-scales
highlighting the correlations between the sub-scales. Average the
ﬁnal sub-scale scores to compute the ﬁnal embodiment score.
This equal weighting of sub-scales contributing to the ﬁnal
embodiment score was based on the percentage of variance of
each principle component after applying the oblique rotation
being roughly equivalent.
To reach the maximum replicability of future results we
recommend the use the following scores as retrieved from our
large scale analysis.

6.1 Category Validation
We ran a correlation study between the different categories that
existed in the previous questionnaire (app, own, loc, tac, ag) and
the proposed categories in the revised questionnaire (appearance,
response, ownership, multisensory). Figure 2 (left) validates the
idea that the previously independent categories of location, tactile
and agency are well represented in the multisensory aggregated
category. From a category perspective the aggregation of subcategories is supported by previous embodiment research
depending on multisensory illusions. These illusions are
achieved through multiple simulations including visuoproprioceptive, visuo-tactile, and visuo-motor. Studies may not
include three types of stimulation, and yet will support a
multisensory experience.
We further ﬁnd that the previous appearance category is
highly correlated with the revised corresponding category with
the same name. Note that appearance transversely affects the
other sub-measures as well. If appearance is not supported,
embodiment is affected, reducing both response and ownership.
There have been many studies on the importance of visual
appearance for the illusions (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Jung et al.,
2018; Ogawa et al., 2019), showing how the illusions did not elicit
when participants were presented with incorrect bodies or hands,
such as a wooden stick instead of a rubber hand.
A lower, yet still signiﬁcant Pearson’s correlation (0.47) was
seen between the previous ownership measure, (own) and the
new ownership sub-measure. Finally our new sub-measure
response, was mostly affected by the previous app sub-measure.
In Figure 2 Right, we explore the correlations between the new
sub-measures, (note this study can be also extracted from our
PCA analysis in the previous sections), we ﬁnd that relatively high
correlations ( > 0.67) were found between appearance and
response as well as between the ownership and multisensory
sub-measures.
We further select three experiments to compare how the
previous and revised questionnaire perform and highlight the
relevance of the sub-measures.

• Appearance  (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5 + R6 + R9 + R16)/8
• Response  (R4 + R6 + R7 + R8 + R9 + R15)/6
• Ownership  (R5 + R10 + R11 + R12 + R13 + R14)/6
• Multi-Sensory  (R3 + R12 + R13 + R14 + R15 + R16)/6
• Embodiment  (Appearance + Response + Ownership +
Multi-Sensory)/4
Regarding the computation of the ﬁnal score, we want to note
that it is common practice for the creation of questionnaires to
produce non-weighted arithmetic for the items (i.e. ignoring the
factor loadings) which are summarized with weight one for each
question and then only weight the whole sub-scale as a mean
(Launois et al., 1996; Boateng et al., 2018). A different
arrangement of sub-scales not based on the PCA loadings and
components would mean the need of a weighted questionnaire
that is much harder to use for the general public. The unweighted
approach involves summing standardized item scores or raw item
scores, or computing the mean for raw item scores (Armor, 1973).

5.1.1 Multi-Sensory Sub-scores
Our effort aims to create a sensitive and weight-free embodiment
questionnaire. However additional sub-sub-scales could be used
for the analysis of agency and to enable backward compatibility
with the prior questionnaire. These would directly relate to the
multi-sensory sub-scale and could be useful for researchers
working on this speciﬁc topic. The current questionnaire subscales re-samples all these questions on to the Multi-sensory
score, however, we can put forward the following agency subscore: Agency  R3 + R13.

6.2 Detail Validation on Study #8
6 VALIDATION

We compared the results of the newly proposed embodiment
questionnaire to the previous questionnaire on data collected
from study #8. This user study used all the previously proposed
questions. The study was a within participants design where each
participant was given a full-body avatar that was both gender and
race matched to participants (Seitz et al., 2020). Participants were
given a mirror in the environment, but they did not walk around.
No harm came to the participant during the experiment and
nothing in the experiment was designed to modify embodiment.
Participants completed all 25 questions from the original
questionnaire immediately after the experiment. Data was

We test this new questionnaire computation against the original
computation on the data collected from nine experiments. In
Figure 1 we can see how the embodiment scores changed in the
different experiments between the new reﬁned questionnaire and
the original questionnaire. The reﬁned questionnaire responses
covers 94% of the scale compared to 87% of the scale with the
original questionnaire. Additionally, the reﬁned scale has more
dispersion with a signiﬁcantly wider standard deviation
(M  1.00, SD  0.24) for each experiment compared to the

collected from n  101 participants (women  56, men  43, nonbinary  2), with ages ranging from 18 to 76,
(M  23.02, SD  9.91).
The original embodiment questionnaire scores (M  4.10,
SD  0.59), were slightly higher than the revised embodiment
questionnaire scores, (M  3.48, SD  1.02). However, in line
with the changes observed when analyzing the entire set of studies
the updated questionnaire provided a wider range of scores
covering 74% of the scale compared to only 45% of the scale
with the original questionnaire. The wider variation in scores
suggests that the updated questionnaire is more sensitive to the
full range of subjective embodiment, and that subjective
embodiment varies drastically by individuals. Due to the
importance of evaluating and testing diverse populations to
mitigate underrepresentation within VR (Peck et al., 2020b) we
investigated if the revised questionnaire was sensitive enough
to detect demographic differences should they exist. Previous
ﬁndings suggest differences between age (Allen et al., 2000;
Moffat et al., 2001). Due to the unequal sample sizes [Age: ≥ 30
(n  9), < 30 (n  92)] analysis was performed using Dunnett’s
test. We chose 30 to be the dividing range due to previous work
suggesting that personality plasticity changes after 30 years
(Terracciano et al., 2006) however further investigations about
age and embodiment should be investigated. A signiﬁcant age
( < 30 or ≥ 30) effect was found in the updated questionnaire,
p  .01, CI  [0.21, 1.59]. No signiﬁcant age effect was found in
the original questionnaire, p  .22, CI  [−0.15, 0.67],
(Figure 3).
Regardless of the interesting results about age and their impact
on the scores, the validation is important because it demonstrates
that with the previous questionnaire the sensitivity was too low to
ﬁnd differences and with the new questionnaire we could ﬁnd
these differences thanks to the enlarged dynamic range. Even

though a signiﬁcant difference between age groups was found, the
sample size supports that this could be a spurious ﬁnding.
This particular research highlights that the revised
questionnaire has better discriminatory power compared to
the originally proposed questionnaire.

6.3 Detail Validation on Study #4
Study #4 was a between-participant study where participants
either saw a collocated self-avatar or did not see a self-avatar. Full
details of the experiment design are described in Peck and Tutar
(2020). When using the revised questionnaire a signiﬁcant main
effect of avatar presence was found, F(1, 56)  15.35, p < 0.001,
η2  0.22. Participants with an avatar had signiﬁcantly higher
embodiment (M  3.43, SD  1.30) compared to participants
who did not see a body (M  2.08, SD  1.50) No signiﬁcant
main effect was found when using the original questionnaire,
F(1, 56)  3.54, p  0.07, η2  0.06. The revised scale was able to
identify the presence of a self avatar, while the original
questionnaire was not. See Figure 4.

6.4 Detail Validation on Study #9
Lee et al. (2019) compared haptic experiences producing
embodiment while controlling a virtual hand that grasped objects
in VR. Participants (male n  22, female n  10) used either a new
haptic device or a regular controller trigger to grasp the objects.
We ﬁnd an signiﬁcant interaction between condition and gender
for the embodiment score (F(1,14)  4.27, p  0.5), whereas the
previous questionnaire wasn’t able to ﬁnd any traces (F(1,14)  0.85,
p  0.37). See Figure 5 Further analysis ﬁnds that this effect is mostly
driven by the appearance sub-scale. Where a trend is also found for
the interaction with gender and condition (p  0.074).
In that experiment the avatar hand was always constant in size.
And perhaps too large when compared to the median female

KMO scores (Q2, Q7, Q23, Q9) and questions that comprised
an unreliable factor (Q3, Q11). Many of the removed questions
were originally added to be dual balanced statements that
control for statement bias (Malhotra, 2006) (i.e. Q2,Q3,Q5,
Q9,Q11), such as asking if participants felt they had more
than one body, that their body was someone else, or that they
did not control the body. The prevalence of these dual
balanced control statements in embodiment questionnaires
follows from standard questionnaire design. However, the
ambiguity of these statements likely confused participants
and led to additional noise within the data. Interestingly,
Q2 and Q3 were previously found unreliable (Peck and
Tutar, 2020) and our analysis further supports that these
are questions of concern. This highlights the importance of
this work since these questions are commonly used in
embodiment questionnaires (Gonzalez-Franco and Peck,
2018) and use of these questions may be disadvantaging
researchers from fully understanding and interpreting their
embodiment results. All in all, our analysis supports that 16 of
the 25 questions are relevant for measuring embodiment.
Our ﬁndings on the number of components also reduced the
sub-scales from 6 to 4. The categories originally labeled: agency

hand size, therefore affecting the appearance of the hand. This
drop in the appearance score might be the underlying reason of
the interaction of embodiment and gender for the different
controllers.
The results highlight not only the higher sensitivity of the new
questionnaire, but also the sensitivity at the sub-scale level. The
results are in line and further highlight how appearance is a very
important trigger for embodiment (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Jung
et al., 2018; Ogawa et al., 2019). This effect was undetected with
the previous questionnaire.

7 DISCUSSION
The current paper has validated many of the original questions
proposed to measure embodiment from (Gonzalez-Franco and
Peck, 2018). The exploratory factor analysis of almost 450
questionnaires has ﬁne tuned the original questionnaire and
removed nine of the original questions. This included
questions that could not be universally applied to
embodiment scenarios (Q4, Q5, Q25), questions that were
correlated with only a couple of other questions or had low

and localization; are no longer presented as independent, but
rather integrated into the other four categories: Appearance,
Response, Ownership, and Multi-sensory. This does not mean
that agency, touch or localization are not important for
embodiment, (Kilteni et al., 2012), but rather that they are
related to other senses and instead contribute to one of the
four prominent embodiment categories. The questions on
motor control and agency were mostly assigned to the
Response category. This makes sense as motor actions can be
considered as yet another type of efferent response. The location
and tactile questions fell into the multi-sensory experience. This
makes sense too, as touch and proprioception are very related in
those questions, such as R14: ”It seemed as if I felt the touch of the
____ in the location where I saw the virtual body touched.”
The revision of the questionnaire highlighted the interrelatedness of the previous categories and supports the use of
sharing questions to measure each category. This inter-relation

between embodiment sub-measures is supported in previous
work. Techniques shown to increase embodiment include
using mirrors, self-location of avatars, and synchronous
movement. A reframing of a questionnaire does not nullify
previous work. Instead, the reframing of the categories
proposes new challenges and interesting insights for future
embodiment research. For example, previous work supports
the importance of agency for inducing embodiment illusions.
The previously proposed questionnaire highlighted questions
that were believed directly related to this topic. However,
participant responses for two of the four questions were
unreliable (low KMO value and low correlations with other
questions). Instead, the two remaining “agency” questions are
each used in two of the three sub-measures.
The inter-dependence of these categories and complicated nature
of embodiment is further highlighted by the percentage of variance
accounted for in each sub-scale, the weights of the pattern matrix, see

Embodiment Questionnaire

Table 4, and the weights of the structure matrix used to cluster
questions, see Table 3. For example, Appearance and Response are
the highest correlated sub-scales (r  0.34) and share three
questions, R4, R6, and R9. In fact, only Ownership and Response
do not directly have overlapping questions. The interdependence
and roughly equal contribution of each sub-scale to overall
embodiment highlights the complicated nature of the sensation
and the importance of using the complete questionnaire to measure
and further the understanding of embodiment.
We further validated the new questionnaire with a study with
101 participants that used the previous 25 questions. That user
study results further showed that the current questionnaire is a
continuation and improvement of the previously proposed
questionnaire (Gonzalez-Franco and Peck, 2018). The general
measure of embodiment was similar, however the sensitivity of
the scale was drastically improved. The updated computation, the
smaller and more relevant question set, and the interrelationship
between questions and embodiment components provide a more
robust alternative and a stronger framework for understanding
embodiment. Additionally, the validation highlights the
importance of using sub-scales to more deeply explore the
importance of the different components that may affect
embodiment, such as age. This was seen when evaluating the
difference in embodiment scores for participants over and under
30 years of age. A signiﬁcant difference was found in the sub-scales
of Appearance, Ownership, and Multi-Sensory, however no
signiﬁcant difference was found in Response. When
considering the low score on Appearance this could be due to
the avatars not being age matched to the older participants
highlighting the importance of having age-matched avatars for
participants over 30.
Regarding the computation of the ﬁnal embodiment scores, as
opposed to the recommendation in the original paper (GonzalezFranco and Peck, 2018) to use PCA, we now recommend the use
of our arithmetic summation. This is because of the validation of
the questions and grouping with our large data set. Using the
computation of embodiment as presented will beneﬁt the
community as it will enable more comparable results with
other studies and research. The questions have been
arithmetically grouped and the percentage of variance of each
sub-scale is roughly even. The inter-relationship of sub-scales was
accounted for by using oblique rotation and further validated by
the correlations between sub-scales and the shared questions
when computing sub-scale scores.
Some questions are still open, such as the optimal Likert use of
the questions. Questionnaires can be presented as time related
never/always response versus an agreement/disagreement scale.
We also think the community would beneﬁt from additional
research demonstrating if more quantitative metrics such as
electrophysiology correlate with this new reﬁned embodiment
questionnaire.

common questions used in previous embodiment studies
(Gonzalez-Franco and Peck, 2018). From our analysis of a
collection of nine experiments using the originally proposed
questionnaire in full or part (totalling almost 450 questionnaires),
we have now been able to validate and streamline it from 25 to 16
critical questions, and from 6 sub-scales to 4. The four sub-scales,
Appearance, Response, Ownership, and Multi-Sensory, further
the understanding of embodiment by clearly deﬁning the
most important aspects of the phenomenon as well as their
interrelations.
We now ask the VR and Embodiment Science community to
widely use this questionnaire whenever a participant is given a
self-avatar. This is of special importance as we know that there
are large inter-individual differences between participants of
studies even when presented with the exact same conditions
(Gonzalez-Franco et al., 2019). The differences in embodiment
scores by age further highlights the necessity of evaluating
diverse participant samples to limit bias being added into
research results (Peck et al., 2020b). Further, our
understanding of the cognitive effects of embodiment is not
well understood, (Peck et al., 2018; Peck and Tutar, 2020). This
suggests that embodiment can be a factor for explaining many
of the results or differences in studies including avatars or
collocated body parts (such as hands).
Furthermore, the new scale of embodiment calibrated in
this paper supports the use of the results between 1–7 as an
absolute and comparable value. This means that users of this
questionnaire can safely claim that a seven score meant their
participants were highly embodied or on the contrary, that a
one score meant their participants did not experience
embodiment of their self-avatars regardless of a control
disembodied condition in experiments. Additionally,
researchers do need to run their own PCA analysis, as the
arithmetic computation proposed here would be sufﬁcient,
and in fact desirable for future comparability.
The work here intends to simplify the use of embodiment
questionnaires through this standard validated questionnaire.
The use of the questionnaire at large will not only help further
the understanding of the effects that derive from embodiment of
avatars, but also can aid in the replication and comparison of
future studies. Both of these aspects will become more relevant as
the democratisation of avatar use for self-representation in VR
becomes more mainstream.
