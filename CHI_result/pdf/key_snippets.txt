 the affective and cognitive regulation potential of embodied technologies remains comparatively underexplored.,This gap matters because human behavior routinely leverages bodily action to regulate cognitive state. Self-touch and certain postures can effectively reduce stress and modulate affect [15]; gestures externalize parts of cognition and facilitate problem solving [8, 13, 16]; and affective touch can buffer acute stress responses and

These works in the literature motivate a central question: Can external systems reproduce these embodied regulation mechanisms—thereby enabling “cognitive offload” through robotic self-touch—without interrupting primary tasks and with parameters that are precise, repeatable, and ethically controllable? To investigate this question, we design experiments in which a chairside robotic arm delivers two represen

Predictive coding models explain the "self vs. other" boundary: predictable, self-generated touches are less intense than unpredictable, external ones. Adjusting temporal delays or trajectory mismatches can modulate this effect, involving cerebellar-somatosensory circuits. Non-zero delays can recalibrate the system,

emporal delays or trajectory mismatches can modulate this effect, involving cerebellar-somatosensory circuits. Non-zero delays can recalibrate the system, using "predictability" to manage agency and ownership in robotic touch [3]. In prosthetics, embodiment is seen as ownership and agency combined, with recommendations for measurement, warning against viewing embodiment as the sole acceptance factor [18]. These perspectives guide the study’s
